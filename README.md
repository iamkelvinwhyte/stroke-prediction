# Stroke Prediction Classification Models Comparison
#### Stroke prediction using a classification algorithm  

### Classification algorithm 

A classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique used to identify the category of new observations based on training data. In Classification, a program learns from the given dataset or observations. It then classifies new observations into several classes or groups.

### Problem Statement 

This analysis aims to build a classification model to detect a stroke. 
Our stroke dataset contains 5109 observations and 11 variables. 

#### Steps In this analysis, we will follow the following stages:

##### Step 1 - Loading the required libraries and modules.

##### Step 2: Reading and exploring the dataset to have insight into the data.

##### Step 3 -Data pre-processing allows the removal of an outlier from the dataset.

##### Step 4 -Data Transformation, Transforming the data to binary for the machine learning algorithm to understand. One-Hot-Encoder is used for the transformation. 

##### Step 5 - Feature Scaling. This technique is used to bring down the values of all the independent features to the same scale. Feature scaling is done using Ski-learn Stander Scaling.

##### Step 6 -Dimensionality reduction using PCA and reducing the number of input variables for a dataset.

##### Step 5 - Building, predicting, and evaluating the model.
